MJM
=====================================
Not just a confirmation
The plan is to make an application that covers live alerts from official groups or organizations that could be fed by the users.

For example: Did you felt the earthquake? and the users, no matter where they are would answer mjm(yes) or no with their location so the organization could map the affected areas. And Thats ONLY ONE of it possible usages. There are plenity of others(Car Steals, Kidnaping, Natural disasters, Prison Break, etc.)
